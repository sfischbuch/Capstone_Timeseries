# Capstone_Timeseries


The Question: 

Can I create an ensemble method of 6 different ARIMA models that is able to predict outcomes  more consistently than any of them individually.

The Data: 

I have raw data in pickled form. Unpickled the raw data takes the form of a column of financial values and their associated timestamp. In addition to the raw data I have separate feeds(also pickled) from 6 ARIMA model variations.  These feeds include their associated predictions, and statistics associated with those predictions (RMSE, R**2, confidence intervals etc) for a two month period.

MVP: 

Develop an ensemble system voting system grouping the existing ARIMA models. Possible methods include using a neural net (Committee of Machines), an ensemble average, different forms of boosting, Iâ€™ll try subsampling first and then once the framework is built modify it to receive different forms of data so it can be used with greater universality.

MVP+  

From the raw data make an RNN predictor (7th model).

MVP++ 

(a)Create a web presence using Flask.
(b) Fold the 7th Model into original ensemble
